# ArgoCD Diff GitHub Action

This action generates a diff between the PR and the state of the cluster for any Applications that are sourced from the
repo that the action is running in.

**Note**: This includes any changes between the head branch (i.e., the feature branch) and the base branch (i.e., the
trunk, e.g., `main`), as well as ways in which the cluster is out-of-sync. Essentially, any diff from an Application
that is sourced from the repo.

## Usage

Example GH action:

```yaml

name: Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  argocd-diff:
    name: Generate ArgoCD Diff
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: argocd-diff-action/argocd-diff-action@v0
        with:
          argocd-exclude-paths: 'path/to/exclude,'
          argocd-extra-cli-args: '--grpc-web'
          argocd-headers: 'Authorization: ${{ secrets.ARGO_CD_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN }},SomeOtherHeader: some-value'
          argocd-server-fqdn: 'argocd.example.com'

## Compatibility

- Requires `argocd-version >= v2.1.0` to support use of [the `--exit-code=false` option on
  `app diff`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/2faa08e710b6da3fdfa88eb1491de0648d004a19).

## How it works

1. Downloads the ArgoCD binary, makes it executable and authenticates the Server.
2. Fetches all the Applications from the ArgoCD API using the `argocd-token`.
3. Filters the Applications to the ones that are sourced from the current repo (using the context of the action),
   targeting the trunk of the repo, and are not in an excluded path.
4. Runs `argocd app diff --local <path>` for each Application.
5. If in the Application diff there is an Application with a change to its `targetRevision`, get the diff for it using
   `--revision`.
    - Note that this won't include any other changes to the App of App (e.g., Helm value changes).
6. Posts the diff output as a comment on the PR (updating the same comment if it already exists).

## Releases & Publishing

Releases are automated using `semantic-release` via [the `release.yml` workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml)
and [the `.releaserc` config file](./.releaserc).

Each release will create a semver tag (e.g., `0.2.0`) and update the floating major version tag (e.g., `v0`) associated
with it.

The action is in early development (v0), which means there may be breaking changes introduced at any time. It's
suggested to pin to the semver release tag until the release of `v1`.

## Contributing

All commits must conform to the Angular commit convention and be done through a PR. Given this, the use of
`Rebase and merge` is preferred to capture each semantic commit in a PR in the changelog.

Check [`commit-analyzer` plugin configuration](./.releaserc#L6)
to see which types cause what releases.

### Local Development

1. Install `nvm`
2. Activate the correct node version `nvm install && nvm use`
3. Install dependencies `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile`
4. Run tests `pnpm run test`

> Note these are unit tests that, currently, cover a small portion of the code base. This will also run on every PR.
